I present to you a voice activation manga reader so one could lay in bed to read manga. 
How to use:

  - replace linke_to_manga variable in main.py with the chapter link.

Voice activation commands. 
'next' = next chapter 
'down'= scroll down 

I've included some hotkeys too if you don't want voice activation. 
keys:
m = next chapter 
right shift = next chapter 
tab =next chapter
p = autoscroll 
b= break autoscroll when you want it to stop. program will still run
